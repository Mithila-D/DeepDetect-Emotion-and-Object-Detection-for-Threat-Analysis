### DeepDetect-Emotion-and-Object-Detection-for-Threat-Analysis
This project enhances residential security using computer vision and deep learning. It integrates gesture recognition, emotion analysis, and object detection to monitor suspicious behavior and identify objects like people and vehicles in real-time. The system also includes emergency features like an alarm button and an emergency contacts page.
# Gesture Recognition Using Computer Vision Techniques
** Why:
- This project enhances residential security by analyzing facial expressions and gestures to identify suspicious behavior. It provides real-time emotion detection, aiding in better surveillance and threat detection.

- What is it About:
The system uses computer vision and deep learning to recognize emotions like fear, anger, or happiness and identify gestures from facial features. It flags potential suspicious behavior by analyzing video footage from security cameras.

** Languages, Libraries, and Prerequisites:
1.Languages: Python
2.Libraries: OpenCV, DeepFace, TensorFlow, NumPy
3.Prerequisites: Basic understanding of Python, machine learning concepts, and computer vision fundamentals
** Steps:
1.Face Detection: Detects faces in video frames using Haar cascades.
2.Feature Extraction: Analyzes facial features like eyes, mouth, and eyebrows.
3.Emotion and Gesture Recognition: Uses pre-trained models to identify emotions (e.g., happy, fear) and gestures (e.g., smile).
3.Suspicious Behavior Detection: Flags individuals based on detected emotions like fear, anger, etc. for further attention.
4.Real-Time Feedback: Provides outputs in real-time for enhanced security monitoring.
### Object Detection Using Deep Learning Frameworks
** Why:
- The project improves residential security by identifying objects like people and vehicles, helping detect anomalies and unauthorized activities.

** What is it About:
-The system uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection in security camera footage. It can classify objects into categories like cars, trucks, and people, aiding in better situational awareness.

** Languages, Libraries, and Prerequisites:
1.Languages: Python
2.Libraries: PyTorch, OpenCV, YOLOv5
3.Prerequisites:Python, deep learning frameworks, and object detection concepts
** Steps:
1.Dataset Preparation
2.Model Loading: Load the YOLOv5 model for object detection.
3.Object Identification: Detects objects like people, cars, and trucks in video footage.
### Emergency Features:
1.Emergency Contacts Page: Displays contact details for quick help.
2.Alarm Button: Triggers an alert sound during emergencies.
